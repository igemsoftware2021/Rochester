Overview

Exponential_Regression_Framework.py, Linear_Regression_Applied.py, Linear_Regression_Framework.py, and curve_fitting_experimentation.ipynb are all related to performing regression analysis, which we do for three models, all of which are part of the pipeline to convert our team's hardware's electrical reading into a predicted concentration in either plasma or serum, two types of blood. These 4 models were all more rough and done along the way, with our final software that converts the input Resistance value into an upvote-downovte for each biomarker being <filename>. Reduction_model_code.txt and v2_flow.m are distinct models that answered different questions for the hardware and wetlab parts of our iGEM project.
