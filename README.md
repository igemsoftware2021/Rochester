Overview

Our Modeling falls into two results-focused/goal-oriented camps: answering questions for our wet lab and hardware, or making our actual readout/diagnosis possible. 
Reduction_model_code.txt and v2_flow.m fall into that first camp, and the remaining models make up our pipeline to convert our team's hardware's electrical reading into a predicted concentration in either plasma or serum, two types of blood. These 4 models were all more rough and done along the way, with our final software that converts the input Resistance value into an upvote-downovte for each biomarker being <filename>.

In an effort to make use of GitHub's wonderful version-control enabling, we have committed several iterations of many of our models as we have improved them, but please read the most recent versions for the most thorough documentation when looking to understand how our models work!
